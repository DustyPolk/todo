# Security Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This Todo API implements comprehensive security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with access tokens (15min expiry) and refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Role-based access control** (admin, user, guest)
- **Password complexity requirements** (12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character)
- **Account lockout** after 5 failed login attempts with exponential backoff
- **Token blacklisting** for secure logout

### 2. API Security Layer
- **Rate limiting** on all endpoints:
  - Authentication endpoints: 5 requests/minute
  - API endpoints: 100 requests/minute
  - Public endpoints: 1000 requests/hour
- **Input validation and sanitization** to prevent injection attacks
- **Request size limits** (10MB maximum payload)
- **CORS protection** with specific allowed origins

### 3. Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS attacks
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)** for HTTPS enforcement
- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** to prevent MIME sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options: DENY** to prevent clickjacking
- **X-XSS-Protection** for legacy browser protection
- **Referrer-Policy** for privacy protection

### 4. CSRF Protection
- **CSRF token generation** for state-changing operations
- **Token validation** with session binding
- **Automatic token cleanup** for expired tokens

### 5. API Key Authentication
- **Programmatic access** via API keys with configurable permissions
- **Key rotation support** with creation and revocation endpoints
- **Usage tracking** with last-used timestamps

### 6. Security Monitoring
- **Security event logging** for all authentication and authorization events
- **Failed login attempt tracking** with IP-based monitoring
- **Security metrics** and health status reporting
- **Real-time alerting** for suspicious activities

### 7. Input Validation
- **XSS prevention** through input sanitization
- **SQL injection protection** via parameterized queries
- **Email format validation** using regex patterns
- **Username format restrictions** (alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen only)

## Security Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Secure logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Current user info

### Security Management (Authenticated)
- `POST /api/security/api-keys` - Create API key
- `GET /api/security/api-keys` - List user's API keys
- `DELETE /api/security/api-keys/{name}` - Revoke API key
- `POST /api/security/csrf-token` - Get CSRF token
- `GET /api/security/events/me` - Get user's security events

### Admin Security Endpoints
- `GET /api/security/events` - Get all security events
- `GET /api/security/security-status` - Get security status and metrics

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key
CSRF_SECRET_KEY=your-csrf-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./todos.db
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration
```python
RATE_LIMIT_AUTH = "5/minute"      # Authentication endpoints
RATE_LIMIT_API = "100/minute"     # General API endpoints  
RATE_LIMIT_PUBLIC = "1000/hour"   # Public endpoints
```

### Security Settings
```python
MAX_REQUEST_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB
MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 5
LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES = 30
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 15
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS = 7
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, etc.)
2. **Use parameterized queries** for all database operations
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server side
4. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing internal details
5. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch security vulnerabilities

### For Deployment
1. **Use HTTPS** in production environments
2. **Set strong JWT secret keys** (256-bit random strings)
3. **Configure proper CORS origins** for your domain
4. **Enable request logging** for security monitoring
5. **Set up automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline

### For Operations
1. **Monitor security events** regularly
2. **Review failed login attempts** for brute force attacks
3. **Rotate API keys** periodically
4. **Update security configurations** based on threat landscape
5. **Backup and test recovery procedures**

## Security Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the security test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest test_security.py -v
```

### Manual Testing
Use the verification script:
```bash
python verify_security.py
```

### Security Checklist
- [ ] JWT tokens expire correctly
- [ ] Rate limiting triggers on abuse
- [ ] Input validation prevents XSS/injection
- [ ] Security headers are present
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Failed logins are logged
- [ ] API keys work for programmatic access
- [ ] Admin endpoints require proper permissions

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

1. **Do not** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** security concerns to the development team
3. **Provide** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Allow** reasonable time for patching before public disclosure

## Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed login attempts per IP/user
- Rate limit violations
- Invalid input attempts (XSS, injection)
- API key usage patterns
- Token refresh frequency
- Admin action auditing

### Alerting Thresholds
- More than 10 failed logins from single IP in 1 hour
- More than 50 rate limit violations in 1 hour
- Any successful admin login outside business hours
- Multiple API key creation/revocation events

## Compliance Notes

This implementation follows security best practices and helps with:
- **OWASP Top 10** protection
- **GDPR** data protection requirements
- **SOC 2** security controls
- **ISO 27001** information security standards

## Security Roadmap

Future security enhancements may include:
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Advanced threat detection with ML
- Integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems
